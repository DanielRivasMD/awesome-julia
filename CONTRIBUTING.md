# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.


## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/DanielRivasMD/awesome-julia/blob/master/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in Julia?
- please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering.


## Removing projects

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
